# RAML

## Editing

RAML supports a native API workbench to edit RAML files; this
workbench is implemented as a plugin for the atom editor (atom.io).

An online API editor is available (API Designer from Mulesoft) that is
roughly similar to the swagger editor. After registration a trial
version is available; long term usage probably requires paid subscription.

## Files

RAML files are specified in YAML-syntax, looking very similar to
Swagger. Structuring of the various endpoints is, of course, somewhat
different.
