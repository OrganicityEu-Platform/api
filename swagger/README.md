# Swagger API Specification

Swagger specifies APIs as JSON or YAML-files. For evaluation, we use YAML,
stored in .yml files.

This directory contains the set of example specifications; for each file,
the tool `bootprint-swagger` formats these into html files for online viewing.
These are stored in subfolders of the respective name. If you change a
specification file, please re-generate it by running `make` and check in the
new files.
